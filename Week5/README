(1) Change Parser.hs as indicated in the file.

40 points.

(2) Change Interpreter.hs as indicated in the file.

40 points.

(3) Write a program in the new language that we have implemented, to
check whether a given number is prime (input in the variable x, output
in the variable y, where y should be zero for false, and non-zero for
true). Test it using the Main program (supplied), after you have
solved exercises 1 and 2.

Please write your program in prime.runxy (which is empty at the
moment), so our TestBench.hs can find it easily.

10 points.

Submission instructions: Keep the names of the files as given. Then
create a zip file with Parser.hs, Interpreter.hs and
primes.runxy. Call the zip file lab5.zip and upload it to canvas.

How to create the zip file from the command line:

If your working folder with your files is called lab5, outside lab5,
run

 $ zip -r lab5.zip lab5

(This will also include the additional files given to you, but that's ok.)
