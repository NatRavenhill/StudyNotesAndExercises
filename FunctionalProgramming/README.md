# Functional Programming

These are the weekly Haskell exercises I completed in the [Functional Programming](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/internal/modules/2013/25344/) module in the School of Computer Science in the year 2013/14,  taught by Martin Escardo. My work is underneath the comments marked "Exercise"  

### Week 2
Simple functions on trees and lists  

### Week 3  
Writing functions to help build an interpreter for an imperative language

### Week 4  
Exercises based on tree parsing

### Week 5  
Extending a parser and interpreter for an imperative language and writing programs that will  run in the interpreter

### Week 6  
Parsing with  a Parser Monad. 

### Week 7  
Exercises using IO, Writer and State monads  


As this was 2013 all of this code uses the old style of monads, so won't work in GHC 7.10!
